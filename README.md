## About

Who's That Pokémon is a passion project created for Pokémon enthusiasts. In this game, players are presented with the silhouette of a Pokémon and must guess the Pokémon's name. The game is built using ReactJS, TypeScript, and Redux for a sleek, responsive user experience.

This project is not affiliated with The Pokémon Company. It is a fan-made project, created out of love for the Pokémon franchise.

## Planned Updates

Here's a list of enhancements I'm planning to add to the game:

- [X] Mobile responsive design: play the game on your phone or tablet.
- [X] Leaderboards: see who's the best Pokémon guesser around.
- [ ] Hints: get helpful hints to help you guess the Pokémon.
- [ ] Multiplayer mode: compete with your friends to guess the Pokémon.

Please note that these updates are subject to change, and some are dependent on external APIs and services.
